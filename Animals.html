                            exibit and gets upset when they are not there for him to play with. He shows that even though hes mean on the outside, hes nice
                            on the inside.

                            which is why he is here in the aquarium. Even though he is hurt, he keeps swimming like nothing is wrong.

                        <h3>About Donna</h3>
                        <p>Donna is one of our new exhibits. She has the ability to spit poison and sometimes she will spit it at the glass. This makes her very dangerous,
                            but she has begun to warm up to people more.

                        <h3>About Freddrick</h3>
                        <p>Freddrick is a really silly tocan. He loves to fly around and hang upside down from his branches. He is always calling out the people that walk by
                            and flashing his brightly colored beak at them.
                        <p>Griffith is one of the odd ones at the zoo. He is both very nice but very mean all at the same time. He had his wings clipped long ago before he was at the zoo,
                            you can see that he still longs for the sky.
